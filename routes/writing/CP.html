        <h4>Megan McGee.</h4>
        <h5>CP</h5>
          <p>Five teenaged boys skateboard past donning soaked hooded sweat shirts of various colors and sizes. The green grass was swollen with precipitation. The concrete sidewalk was different shades of gray from the drying rain. A derelict hides under a ten gallon plastic garbage bag as a refuge from the late winter rain to my left. A two young women jog by breathless from their run “it’s not like it matters, a dime a dozen, they are.” One calls to the other in a shrill voice. </p>
          <p>The smell of boiling Hebrew National hotdog stands and the smell of unwashed human carried on a westerly wind. The ominous clouds, hung heavy and threatening with rain. Sparrows scurry to a dropped cracker from a bundled up toddler’s stroller. The baby shrieks with delight at the sight as her mother takes the box of animal crackers from her hand. The honking of cabs from the Central Park South circle rings in my ears. A group of tourists in matching rain slickers snapping pictures on disposable cameras. The derelict stirs and groans, pulling the bag closer to his body. The mother of the toddler searches for her ringing Blackberry checks the caller ID and ignores the call. </p>
          <p>A suave-looking suit or trust-fund baby in a suit caveats by and flashes a smile to another jogging woman. His umbrella, swinging back and forth with each step, twinkled in the partly-cloudy afternoon sun. The jogger smiles back half-heartedly. She had other things on her mind, other than his perfectly straight teeth and his Armani blazer. He realizes her disinterest and quickly busies himself brushing the rain from his shoulders. The jogger is a gorgeous blonde, 5’6 with corkscrew curls and a bit too much Botox. The corporate executive’s strong cologne traveled on the west wind as he strutted along towards the Apple store. The smell was headache-inducing and familiar, and I would guess that a high school boyfriend of mine had once worn it on a date. </p>
          <p>A deafening group of tourists, nearly shouting with excitement enters the park. They are speaking in some Eastern-European tongue and become ecstatic at the sight of an oversized sickly looking squirrel that must have been near death. It stopped the group in their tracks, planting itself in the middle of the pavement and stared directly at the eldest member of the group. Instantly each of the ten or so tourists searched their drawstring bags for their phones and cameras. I had never seen a group of people so excited about a rodent. An annoyed Latina nearly falls over the youngest member of the group. She is yapping into her iPhone something about “Mothaf**king tourisma, estupido”.</p>
